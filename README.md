P13

*we already have new data from P13 and P3 we may only use P8 and Mouse brain (control) from the old data

# New data processed by Kamil in 2020

file name           Real name

P13S_S1_DGE         = P13S

P16S_S1_DGE         = T16S

P192S_S3_DGE        = T192S

LIH21               = T470S 

LIH22               = T101S

we are still waiting for the following samples, hopefully by next week

T233S

T347S
